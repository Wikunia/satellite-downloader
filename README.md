# Satellite Downloader

!**Work in progress**!


A small tool for batch-downloading satellite images from csv data.

#### Installation

First, install all the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, start the app ```npm start``` and visit ```http://localhost:1337```.

#### About

This tool can be used for downloading satellite images from the [google maps static api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/) by giving a dataset with coordinates or places to search for. The images are then rendered as pngs and sent to the user as a zip file.

Inspiration: [Prison Map](http://prisonmap.com/)
